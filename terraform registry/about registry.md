The Terraform Registry is an interactive site for finding a wide range of Terraform
integrations (providers) and configuration packages (modules).
The Registry's purpose is to provide plugins for managing any
infrastructure API, pre made modules for fast configuring
common infrastructure components, and samples of good Terraform code.
